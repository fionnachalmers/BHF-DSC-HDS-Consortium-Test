## GDPPR - General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research

### Description
GDPPR = General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research. This dataset is an extract/subset from primary care (GP) systems - designed to address the urgent need for GP data in response to Covid-19 planning & research. The dataset does not contain all information held in primary care systems (e.g., registration, long-term conditions, etc.) but rather it looks to meet the needs of a particular data use case. The data is in a long format, with one patient having many records for even a single GP appointment, and each record describing one patient date-code combination.
