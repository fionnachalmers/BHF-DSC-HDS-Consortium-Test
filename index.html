            <p>The dashboard provides an overview and interactive summaries of the datasets currently available through CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT within the secure Trusted Research Environments (TREs) provided by NHS England for England, the National Data Safe Haven for Scotland and the SAIL databank for Wales. 
        <br><br>CVD-COVID-UK aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, linked, nationally collated healthcare datasets across the four nations of the UK. 
        COVID-IMPACT is an expansion of this approach to address research questions looking at the impact of COVID-19 on other health conditions and their related risk factors. 
        <br><br>The dashboard can be used to explore the data dictionaries, data coverage and data completeness for each of the datasets provisioned in England, Scotland, and Wales. 
        The datasets include those from primary and secondary care, COVID lab tests and vaccinations, deaths, critical care, prescribing/dispensing, cardiovascular and stroke audits, maternity services and mental health.</p>

            <p>This work is carried out with the support of the BHF Data Science Centre led by HDR UK (BHF Grant no. SP/19/3/34678). This study makes use of de-identified data held in NHS England’s Secure Data Environment service for England, the SAIL Databank and the Scottish National Data Safe Haven and made available via the BHF Data Science Centre’s CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT consortium. This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support. We would also like to acknowledge all data providers who make health relevant data available for research.

<br><br>The study makes use of anonymised data held in the Scottish National Safe Haven. The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the eDRIS Team (Public Health Scotland) for their involvement in obtaining approvals, provisioning and linking data and the use of the secure analytical platform within the National Safe Haven.

<br><br>This study makes use of anonymised data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support. We would also like to acknowledge all data providers who make anonymised data available for research. We wish to acknowledge the collaborative partnership that enabled acquisition and access to the de-identified data, which led to this output. The collaboration was led by the Swansea University Health Data Research UK team under the direction of the Welsh Government Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) and includes the following groups and organisations: the SAIL Databank, Administrative Data Research (ADR) Wales, Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW), Public Health Wales, NHS Shared Services Partnership (NWSSP) and the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST).
