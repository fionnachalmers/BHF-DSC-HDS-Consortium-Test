As with {ref}`testing<rr-testing>`, a key objective of code review is to remove mistakes and bad practice from changes made to a software project before those changes enter the main code base.
However, it also has a number of other direct and indirect benefits to projects. These are discussed below.

Code reviews are an effective method for improving software quality. McConnell
(2004) suggests that unit testing finds approximately 25% of defects, function
testing 35%, integration testing 45%, and code review 55-60%. While that
means that none of these methods are good enough on their own, and that they
should be combined, clearly code review is an essential tool here.
